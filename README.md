# Court Data Fetcher

A simple Flask web app that lets you enter Indian court case details (Case Type, Case Number, Year) and shows the case information.

For this internship task, I chose to keep it in **sample data mode** (due to CAPTCHA restrictions on many court portals).  
The structure is ready for real scraping â€” you only need to implement the `fetch_case_real()` function in `scraper.py` for your chosen court.
